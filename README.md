  <summary><h3> My coding journey </h3></summary> 
  <p>My journey into programming started during my Erasmus internship when I took a programming subject. At first, it felt overwhelming, and I nearly gave up, believing it was too difficult. I passed the subject, but programming didn’t seem like my path at the time. However, that changed when I joined a research institute and saw colleagues working with Python and R. Inspired by their work, I saw programming as a personal challenge I wanted to overcome.</p>
  <p>Determined to improve, I took courses, practiced, and eventually succeeded—earning my first certificate in Data Analysis with Python. Alongside this, I was selected for a master’s thesis investigating stress responses in aquaculture fish using transcriptomics and proteomics. This gave me the perfect opportunity to apply my Python and R skills, creating visualizations like heatmaps, volcano plots, and boxplots. I also learned to work with remote servers using MobaXterm and gained experience in Bash scripting.</p>
  <p>What once seemed impossible became one of my greatest strengths. Programming is now an essential part of my research, and I’m excited to continue growing in bioinformatics and computational biology.</p>
